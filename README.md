The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) is a financial model that calculates the expected rate of return for an asset or investment based on its systematic risk, represented by beta (Î²), and the market risk premium

Despite its widespread use, CAPM has several limitations and criticisms. It makes unrealistic assumptions and relies on a linear interpretation of risk vs. return, which does not always hold true in real-world scenarios. The empirical record of CAPM is poor, and it fails to explain certain anomalies in stock market returns

The Fama French model is an extension of CAPM that includes additional factors to explain stock market returns. The three-factor model, developed by Eugene Fama and Kenneth French, adds size and value factors to the market risk factor in CAPM

The CAPM and Fama French models are fundamental tools in finance for understanding the relationship between risk and return. While CAPM provides a basic framework for evaluating investment risk, the Fama French models offer a more comprehensive approach by incorporating additional factors. However, both models have their limitations and are subject to ongoing critique and refinement in the field of finance.
